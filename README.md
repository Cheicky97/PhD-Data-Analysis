# 👨‍🎓 PhD-Data-Analysis
This repository contains scripts I have written in the scope of my PhD, to analyse data and to perform some geometrical transformation on conjugated polymers.

## [📂 Fortran code](fortran/)
This folder contains, the code I developped specifically for analysing data from exciton diffusion simulations.
I gathered different piece of code into a single package.
That simplify the use of the code by making it possible to just specify in an input file keywords of calculation to be performed.
## [📂 Python](Python/)
Essentially for plotting and input/output files management purposes.
Designed for CPMD code output standards, but possibly transferable to other compatible files type.
