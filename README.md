# 👨‍🎓 PhD-Data-Analysis
This repository contains scripts I have written in the scope of my PhD, to analyse data and to perform some **geometrical transformation** on **conjugated polymers**.

## [📂 Fortran code](fortran/)
This folder contains the code I developped specifically for analysing data from **exciton** diffusion simulations.
I gathered different pieces of code into a single **package**. That **simplify the use** of the code by making it possible to just specify in an input file keywords indicating calculations to be performed.
## [📂 Python](Python/)
Essentially for plotting and input/output files management purposes and also for customising the geometrie of conjugated polymers and small molecules.
Designed for **CPMD code** output standards, but possibly transferable to other compatible files type.
